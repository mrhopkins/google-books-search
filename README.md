# (React) Google Books Search

https://google-books-search-react-mern.herokuapp.com/

## Overview

In this activity, I created a new React-based Google Books Search app. This required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. Node, Express and MongoDB are used so users can save books to review or purchase later.
